;; STMX v2.0.0 optimization:
;; treat initargs and initforms uniformly, i.e. put a TVAR in each transactional slot
;; in INITIALIZE-INSTANCE :before method, and let SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS
;; store initargs and initforms into the tvars during normal inizialization.
;;
;; In this way, we no longer need to patch the slots
;; *PARTIALLY* by wrapping initforms with (tvar ,initform) at class declaration time,
;; and *PARTIALLY* by reflectively modifying initargs at runtime
;; inside INITIALIZE-INSTANCE main method
;;
;; This has two benefits:
;; 1) performance: overriding INITIALIZE-INSTANCE main method is slow.
;; 2) uniformity and bug freedom: now a programmer can declare :initform (tvar ...)
;;    and it will work as expected.
;;
;; Problem: this trick breaks CMUCL and ABCL, which bypass SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS
;; during CLOS objects initialization. In those cases, define instead the main method
;; INITIALIZE-INSTANCE ((obj class-name))
;; In any case, *never* define any method INITIALIZE-INSTANCE :after ((obj class-name))
;; keep them available for application programmers
